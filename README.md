# Let's make a weather sensor with live infomation and Arduino
## Only using Node MCU and internet
To acomplish this goal I can only make use of the Node MCU and internet to simulate a weather sensor.
While looking for information online I realised most of the solutions for weather forecast are using rain sensors, humidity sensors and barometric sensors.
So in order to 

## How to make Arduino collect information online and display it in Serial monitor
To learn how to do this, I searched online this exact question. This is what I found:
